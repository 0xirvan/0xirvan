# About me
1. linux nerd.
2. *I use Arch btw...* but I promise, I won’t judge you if you’re not.
3. **Golang** and **Typescript** fans — clean, powerful, and never leave me questioning my life choices.
4. My code might not always compile, but at least it’s always interesting.


Yes, I’m probably using Arch right now.
