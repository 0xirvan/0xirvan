# About me
1. linux nerd.
2. *I use Arch btw...* but I promise, I won’t judge you if you’re not.
3. **Golang** and **Typescript** fans — clean, powerful, and never leave me questioning my life choices.
4. My code might not always compile, but at least it’s always interesting.
5. **Suck at PHP because...** "I prefer languages where bugs don’t magically appear just by looking at the code. Also, I’m pretty sure PHP was designed to make developers question their life choices."

Yes, I’m probably using Arch right now.
